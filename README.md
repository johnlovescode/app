# app

I'm working through the book AngularJS by example written by Chandermani published by packtpub.  
This is my first foray into the angular framework. As a note, most of this code it written by mr Chandermani.
I hold no license to this code and am purely using it for learning purposes. (forthwith, I will be looking into any potential legal problems with me posting this code, and it may be coming down very soon.)

I am just past chapter 2 and will be adding more at about a chapter a day.
